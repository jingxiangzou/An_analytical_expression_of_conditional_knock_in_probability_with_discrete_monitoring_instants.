# An analytical expression of knock-in probability under discrete monitoring
The question is as follows:

Suppose a stock follows Geometric Brownian Motion, with a dividend rate of $q$, the risk-free interest rate being $r$ and the stock's volatility being $\sigma$. Define 'knock-in price' $KI$ as the price the stock reaches when it constitutes a 'knock-in'.  Suppose the time zero price of the stock is $S_0$ and the price in a month is $S_1; S_1 > KI$; Please calculate the knock-in probability when the stock price is monitored once per day.
